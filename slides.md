Outline:

Why package your python?

cleaner than git-cloning stuff
    and managing your PYTHONPATH

tired of `pip install -r requirements.txt`

better than git submodules for things which depend on things

if you want to make a CLI tool, can help you get it on your path for easy use
    `entry_points`

what you need to easily distribute your software (pypi, private repo, github)
