# Why package up your python?

cleaner than git-cloning stuff
    and managing your PYTHONPATH

tired of `pip install -r requirements.txt`

better than git submodules for things which depend on things

if you want to make a CLI tool, can help you get it on your path for easy use
    `entry_points`

what you need to easily distribute your software (pypi, private repo, github)



!SLIDE

# Why distribute your code?

to give back to the awesome python community

as a part of building a career: easier to get hired with good work in the public eye

you actually want other people to use it

```pip install package-name```
vs
```git clone github.com
vi README
pip install -r requirements.txt
#scratches head???
#gives up
```
